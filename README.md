# Diabetes-Drug-Interactions_and_Risks

This dataset contains detailed information about active compounds used in diabetes treatment, their interactions, and the associated risk levels. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for analyzing drug interactions in diabetes management and assessing potential risks.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **drug_1**: Name of the first active compound (e.g., Metformin, Insulin).
- **drug_2**: Name of the second active compound.
- **interaction_type**: Type of interaction observed between the two drugs 
- **risk_level**: Categorized risk level associated with the interaction. Possible values are:
  - `Low`: Minimal risk, unlikely to cause significant adverse effects.
  - `Medium`: Moderate risk, requires caution and monitoring.
  - `High`: Significant risk, potential for severe adverse effects.
- **notes**: Additional comments or details about the interaction (e.g., clinical observations, pharmacological explanations).

## Use Cases

This dataset can be utilized in a variety of applications, including:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Training algorithms to predict drug interaction risks.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Assisting healthcare professionals in selecting safe and effective drug combinations for diabetes treatment.
- **Pharmaceutical Research**: Analyzing patterns in drug interactions and exploring potential synergies or conflicts.
- **Educational Purposes**: Providing a resource for pharmacology and medical students to study drug interactions.

## Dataset Format

The dataset is provided in CSV format for ease of use. Each row represents a unique drug interaction and its associated risk level.
